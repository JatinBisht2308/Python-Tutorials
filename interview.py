# what is python?
# python is one of the programming langauges which helps in comuunication with the cpu to perform sevral tasks in milli seconds.
# what is programming language
# programming language is a language which we use to communicate with the cpu or computer.(as we are using english for our understanding similarly use python for communicating with the cpu.
# what are the applications of python
# pythons can be used in vast area of technology like apps, website, ai and machine learning , game development,etc etc
# where we can code?
# writing codes is similar to writing letter to someone who only understands a particular langauge
# how to use repl effectively
# log in to repl make your id and then start using it.
# print statement
# so as you can see some interface is already opened then you have to click in anywhere right in the center and then start writng. lets print hello cmap k12 ians print("hello camp k12 ians")
# variables in python
# operator basic 
# one question that sir has given me to solve and the students only know that python is only a snake

# -----------------learning started------------------------------
print(1+1)
print(1*2)
print(2-1)
print(4/2)
print(5/2)
print(5//2)
print(2 *2*2)
# to the power
print(2 ** 3)
# remainder modulus
print(10%3)
# string values
print('jatin')
print("bisht")
print('jatin' "bisht")
print('my aleins are very "smart"')
# what if we want to print a string more than 10 or 30 times(using \n)
print(20 * ' jatin\n')
# python dont convert it using your intelligence
print(r'jatin\nbisht\n')

# varibales in python
x = 2
print(x)
print(x+3)
# variables is something which is changeable
x = 100
print(x)
name = "camp k12"
print(name)

print("Please input first number pranav")
# python takes user input in the form of string
x = int(input())
print("Please input second number pranav")
# so we have to change the input to integer that why we are type casting it to integer
y = int(input())
add = x+y
sub = x - y 
multi = x*y
div = x/y
print("Addition of ",x, "and ",y,"is:",add)
print("Substaction of ",x, "and ",y,"is:",sub)
print("Multiplication of ",x, "and ",y,"is:",multi)
print("Division of ",x, "and ",y,"is:",div)

# Start with a quote
# Never get upsest or demotivated during learning something specially python or nay other programming languages because there is infinite sources but a single person cant remember all the things so your work is to learn the basics and a bit advanced of a language specially python and the skill that you have to built is the thinking and creative mindset because you can every thing either game development, app dev, web dev, machine learning and also the iot technology and all. So sit back and take a deep breath becuase this fun interactive and full of knowledge course will be the life changing course for somoe of the students over here, i will tell you a story about my self (ma ek din aisi kisi workshop ma chala gya tha college ki and that workshop is the life changing workshop of my life i dont know what inspires me but before 1 year i was literally 0 at coding and building logics and now im your instructor but yaa it takes a lot of effort one thing i think i shoukd say in the beginning that i cant only teach the basics but in programming you learn more by doing and dint affraid of error in the because error are your freinds that push you to get better then the past so whenever you face any error be happy and give your 100 and 10 % to solve that error simlarly reach out new things and happy while acheiving failure in it because failures are the root of success.)
